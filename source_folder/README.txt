GeodiversityCalculator v1.00

This plugin calculates geodiversity over a custom polygon. These are the thematic subindices: geology, soil, relief, hydrography (line and polygon features), mineralogy and palaeontology.
 Mostly QGIS proccessing tools and Saga tools are implemented in the code.
 Important remarks:
    1. You can only use SHP and GPKG files.
    2. The files have to be in the same CRS, otherwise the plugin will run into an error.
    3. You can omit thematic indices - this way you can calculate each subindex or a combination of subindices separately.
    4. The methodology is based on: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239942809_Geodiversity_Assessment_of_Parana_State_Brazil_An_Innovative_Approach
    5. The methodology was refined for QGIS by: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354059504_Refinement_Proposals_for_Geodiversity_Assessment_-_A_Case_Study_in_the_Bakony-Balaton_UNESCO_Global_Geopark_Hungary
